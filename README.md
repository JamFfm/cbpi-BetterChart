# cbpi-BetterChart
Add a new chart engine to cbpi.

This version needs the CBPi 3 addon "ExtendedMenue" which is brilliant.
Thanks to MiracelVip

This version does not add a bar in the bottom of the CBPi3 window.

This is done by ExtendedMenue.

This is the reason why you need both with his version.
Still beta.

Give it a try
